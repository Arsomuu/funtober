#### **Creating a Thumbnail**
If you're adding a new game or activity, you will need to create a thumbnail. To ensure consistency and style, follow our [Thumbnail Guide](THUMBNAIL_GUIDE.md). Hereâ€™s an overview:
  
- Use an image generator like **Freepik AI** to create the thumbnail.
- Ensure the game name is prominent in **large, bold font**.
- Save the thumbnail in the **`assets`** folder.
- Import and export it in the **`index.ts`** file.
- Update the game object in **`funtober.ts`** to include the new thumbnail.

For more details, refer to the full [Thumbnail Guide](THUMBNAIL_GUIDE.md).

### 5. Test Your Changes
